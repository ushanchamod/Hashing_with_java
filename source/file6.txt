The high sample rates and high quality of SDRs can be used to
explore the relatively large range of frequencies of the PJ and RJ in the light
source of the AMCW ToF cameras by setting a suitable local oscillator frequency
to get a large intermediate frequency (less than the Nyquist frequency)
in the dongle. Also, this concept may be used to find the jitter in the light
source of the aforementioned two modulation types of ToF range imaging cameras
as well as in any other relevant applications. In addition, it may possible
to modify the DSP engine in the dongle which is a software based controller in
order to get maximum benefit but this may not be a straightforward process.
In Chapter 7, the influence of the periodic jitter on range measurements
was investigated. Can we compensate the PJ amount in the first phase step
(by determining and correcting it) before it proceeds to the second phase step
and so on, in the correlation function within the integration period? With
the influence of the PJ in each phase step a constant (a fixed amount), then
it can be further analysed with the crosstalking between phase steps, during
the integration period. But if it is not a constant (random behaviour),
then it will be difficult to compensate for the influence of the PJ on range 
measurements.
