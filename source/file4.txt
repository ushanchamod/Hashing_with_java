But with modulation frequency increases and integration period decreases likely 
in the near future, periodic jitter may have a measurable detection affect on ranging. 
The influence of random jitter is also investigated by obtaining an analytical model 
based on stochastic calculus by using fundamental statistics and Fourier analysis. 
It is assumed that the random jitter follows the Gaussian distribution.
Monte Carlo simulation is performed on the model obtained for a 1 ms 
integration period. We found increasing the modulation frequency above
approximately 400 MHz with random jitter of 140 ps has a measurable affect
on ranging. During the last decade, the ToF range imaging cameras have significantly
improved and have been used in various applications from agricultural sectors
to engineering industries. With the improvement of the technology to build
the depth sensor, novel applications of ToF range imaging will increase. At
present, more researchers are mainly focused on the noise investigation in
these cameras. However, from this thesis, we found that the jitter significantly
influences range measurements therefore it is worth further investigating jitter
in ToF range imaging systems. Several investigations could be extended to
further perform the ToF range imaging systems due to the jitter influence on
measurements as follows.
