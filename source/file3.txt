This is a cost effective alternative to the expensive real time medium speed digital oscilloscope. 
However, it is shown that this method has some significant limitations, (1) it can measure
the jitter only up to half of the intermediate frequency obtained from the down
shift of the amplified radio frequency with the local oscillator which is less than
the Nyquist frequency of the dongle and (2) if the number of samples per cycle
captured from this dongle is not sufficient then the jitter extraction does not
succeed since the signal is not properly (smoothly) represented. 
Finally, the periodic and random jitter influence on range measurements 
made with AMCW range imaging cameras are studied. An analytical model
for the periodic jitter on the range measurements under the heterodyne and
homodyne operations in AMCW ToF range imaging cameras is obtained in
the frequency domain. The analytical model is tested through simulated data
with various parameters in the system. The product of angular modulation
frequency of the camera and the amplitude of the periodic jitter is a characteristic
parameter for the phase error due to the presence of periodic jitter.
We found that for currently available AMCW cameras (modulation frequency
less than 100 MHz), neither periodic nor random jitter has a measurable effect
on range measurement.
