The time of flight (ToF) range imaging cameras indirectly measure the time
taken from the modulation light source to the scene and back to the camera
and it is this principle that is used in depth cameras to perform depth
measurements. This thesis is focused on ToF cameras that are based on the
amplitude modulated continuous wave (AMCW) lidar techniques which measure
the phase difference between the emitted and reflected light signals. Due
to their portable size, feasible design, low weight and low energy consumption,
these cameras have high demand in many applications. Commercially available
AMCW ToF cameras have relatively high noise levels due to electronic
sources such as shot noise, reset noise, amplifier noise, crosstalk, analogue to
digital converters quantization and multipath light interference. Many noise
sources in these cameras such as harmonic contamination, non-linearity, multipath
interferences and light scattering are well investigated. In contrast, the
effect of electronic jitter as a noise source in ranging cameras is barely studied.
Jitter is defined to be any timing movement with reference to an ideal
signal. An investigation of the effect of jitter on range imaging is important
because timing errors potentially could cause errors in measuring phase, thus
in range.
