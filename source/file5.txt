The proposed methodology in Chapters 4 and 5 could be extended to correct
range measurements after extracting and measuring the RJ and PJ in the
light signal of the camera. This will be very useful since the available jitter can
be compensated before the measurement. Since for a particular configuration
of the AMCW camera (with default modulation frequency and integration 
period), the periodic and random jitter in the illumination source is fixed
amounts which can be computed with the proposed methodology. Then, considering
the benchmark numerical results in Chapters 7 and 8 for the influence
of the periodic and random jitter on range measurements, respectively, can
be applied for compensating of the measurement. In addition, the proposed
algorithm may be applied to extract the jitter in other types of ToF range
imaging cameras such as pulse based and pseudo noise based modulation cameras.
This methodology can be used for jitter measurement in any kind of
application where the reference clock signal cannot be accessed.
A cheaper SDR USB dongle with the proposed algorithm for jitter extraction
in ToF cameras at lower frequencies in the RF signal was investigated in
Chapter 6.
